# 🧠 Intro to Programming and Javascript

JavaScript is a **high-level, interpreted scripting language** that enables you to make web pages interactive.

## 📌 What Makes a Programming Language?

A **programming language** is a formal language that provides a set of instructions for a computer to perform specific tasks.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Syntax**: Rules that define valid structure.
- **Semantics**: The meaning behind the syntax.
- **Control Structures**: `if`, `for`, `while`, etc.
- **Data Types & Variables**: Ways to store and manipulate data.
- **Functions/Procedures**: Code reusability and abstraction.
- **Runtime**: Environment where code is executed (browser, OS, interpreter, VM, etc.).

> Think of a programming language like a set of tools and grammar that lets you “talk” to the computer.

## 🧠 JavaScript: Explained in Depth

**"JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that enables you to make web pages interactive."**

Let’s break that sentence down:

### 1. ✅ High-Level
- **Meaning**: JavaScript abstracts away most of the complex details of the machine (like memory management).
- **Comparison**:
  - JavaScript: `let a = 5;`
  - C: `int a = 5;`
  - Assembly: `MOV AX, 5`

> High-level = easier for humans to read and write.

### 2. ⚙️ Interpreted
- JavaScript is **interpreted** by the browser — it reads and executes code line-by-line.
- **No compilation** needed before running.
- Modern JS engines (like V8 in Chrome) use **JIT (Just-In-Time)** compilation for performance boosts.

**Compare with:**
| Language     | Type         | How it runs              |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| JavaScript   | Interpreted  | Runs in browsers or Node |
| Python       | Interpreted  | Uses Python interpreter  |
| C/C++        | Compiled     | Must be compiled first   |
| Java         | Compiled + Interpreted | Compiled to bytecode, run by JVM |

### 3. 🔧 Scripting Language
- Originally designed to add behavior to web pages.
- Used for **automation**, **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, etc.
- Now capable of full application development (frontend + backend).

### 4. 🎨 Enables Interactivity
JavaScript can:
- Update content dynamically
- Handle clicks and form inputs
- Load data from APIs
- Animate elements
- Validate forms

🧪 Without JavaScript, websites are static. With it, they’re alive and reactive.

## 🤔 What About HTML, CSS, and SQL?

These are essential web technologies, but **not programming languages** in the traditional sense.

### 🔤 HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- **Purpose**: Defines the **structure** of a webpage.
- Not logic-based — no loops, conditions, or variables.
- Markup language, not procedural or functional.

### 🎨 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- **Purpose**: Defines the **style and layout** of HTML elements.
- You can define animations, transitions, responsiveness — but again, **no logic** or dynamic behavior.
- Declarative, not imperative.

### 🧮 SQL (Structured Query Language)
- **Purpose**: Communicate with and manipulate relational databases.
- Used to **query**, **insert**, **update**, and **delete** data.
- It’s a **domain-specific language**, not general-purpose like JavaScript or Python.

| Technology | Type                  | Use Case                         |
|------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| HTML       | Markup Language        | Page structure                   |
| CSS        | Style Sheet Language   | Styling/layout                   |
| SQL        | Query Language         | Database operations              |
| JavaScript | Programming Language   | Logic + Interactivity            |

- **JavaScript** is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose **programming language**.
- It powers the **logic** of modern web applications, unlike HTML and CSS which focus on **structure and design**.
- Compared to compiled languages like C++, JS is more flexible but less performant for low-level tasks.
